# Deployment Guide for HEIC to PNG Converter

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why Netlify Doesn't Work

**Netlify is for static sites only.** Your Flask application needs a server that can:
- Run Python code continuously
- Process uploaded files
- Handle dynamic requests

Netlify only serves static HTML/CSS/JS files and serverless functions (which have strict limits).

## ‚úÖ Recommended Platforms (Free Options Available)

Here are the best platforms for deploying this Flask app, ranked by ease of use:

---

## Option 1: Render.com (Recommended) ‚≠ê

**Pros:** Free tier, automatic deployments, very easy setup
**Cons:** Free tier spins down after inactivity (15 min to restart)

### Deploy to Render:

1. **Create a Render account** at https://render.com

2. **Create a new Web Service:**
   - Click "New +" ‚Üí "Web Service"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Use these settings:
     - **Name:** heic-converter (or your choice)
     - **Runtime:** Python 3
     - **Build Command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
     - **Start Command:** `gunicorn app:app`
     - **Instance Type:** Free

3. **Click "Create Web Service"**

4. Your app will be live at `https://heic-converter.onrender.com` (or your chosen name)

**Note:** The free tier sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity, so first load may take 30-60 seconds.

## Option 2: Railway.app

**Pros:** Simple deployment, generous free tier, fast
**Cons:** Free tier credit limit ($5/month)

### Deploy to Railway:

1. **Create account** at https://railway.app

3. **Select your repository**

4. **Railway will auto-detect settings** from `railway.json`

5. **Add environment variables if needed** (none required for basic setup)

6. Your app will be automatically deployed!

## Option 4: PythonAnywhere

**Pros:** Python-specific, good free tier
**Cons:** More manual configuration required

### Deploy to PythonAnywhere:

1. **Create account** at https://www.pythonanywhere.com

### Deploy to Fly.io:

   curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Create Dockerfile** (or I can create one for you)

## üîß Local Development

For local testing (always works):

## üìã Quick Comparison

| Platform | Free Tier | Ease of Setup | Speed | Best For |
|----------|-----------|---------------|-------|----------|
| **Render** | ‚úÖ Yes (sleeps) | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Fast | Quick deploy |
| **Railway** | ‚úÖ $5 credit | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Very Fast | Personal use |
| **Heroku** | ‚ùå $5/month | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Fast | Production |
| **PythonAnywhere** | ‚úÖ Yes (limited) | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Medium | Python-focused |
| **Fly.io** | ‚úÖ Yes (limited) | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | Very Fast | Advanced users |

## üöÄ My Recommendation

**For you: Use Render.com**

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect to Render
3. Done! (literally 2 minutes)

The free tier is perfect for personal use and testing. The app "sleeps" after 15 minutes of no use, but wakes up automatically when someone visits.
