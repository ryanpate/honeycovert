# Quick Test Guide - Image Size Reduction Feature

## Testing Locally

### 1. Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the application
python app.py
```

### 2. Open in Browser
Navigate to: `http://localhost:5000`

### 3. Test the Feature

**What You Should See:**
- The familiar upload area at the top
- A new purple-bordered section labeled "Output Size:" between the file list and convert button
- A dropdown with 4 options:
  - Original (100%)
  - Large (75%) ‚Üê **Selected by default**
  - Medium (50%)
  - Small (25%)
- Helper text: "Reduce size to save space and speed up uploads"

**Test Scenarios:**

#### Test 1: Single File at Different Sizes
1. Upload one HEIC file
2. Select "Original (100%)" from dropdown
3. Click "Convert to PNG"
4. Note the file size of downloaded PNG
5. Upload the same HEIC file again
6. Select "Small (25%)" from dropdown
7. Convert and compare file sizes

**Expected Result:** The 25% version should be significantly smaller in both dimensions and file size

#### Test 2: Multiple Files
1. Upload 3-5 HEIC files
2. Select "Medium (50%)"
3. Convert to PNG
4. Extract the ZIP file
5. Check that all images are resized proportionally

**Expected Result:** All images should be 50% of their original dimensions

#### Test 3: Default Behavior
1. Upload files without changing the dropdown
2. Convert

**Expected Result:** Files should be converted at 75% (Large) by default

- [ ] Chrome/Edge
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari

All should display the dropdown correctly and submit the size parameter.

## Deployment Testing
